# JavaScript Conditional Operator

This repository demonstrates the use of the **JavaScript Conditional (Ternary) Operator (`? :`)**. The conditional operator is a shorthand for the `if-else` statement and is widely used for making quick decisions in JavaScript.

## 📝 About
The **conditional (ternary) operator** allows you to write concise conditional expressions in JavaScript. It follows this syntax:

```javascript```
```condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;```

Example:

```let age = 18;```
```let message = age >= 18 ? "You are an adult." : "You are a minor.";```
```console.log(message); // Output: You are an adult.```
